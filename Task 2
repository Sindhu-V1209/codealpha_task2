 The chatbot will recognize user intents based on keyword matching and respond with predefined answers:

import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
import string

# Sample FAQ dataset
faq_data = {
    "hours": "We are open from 9 AM to 5 PM, Monday through Friday.",
    "location": "Our main office is located at 123 Main Street, Springfield.",
    "services": "We offer a variety of services including web development, SEO, and digital marketing.",
    "contact": "You can contact us at contact@example.com or call us at 123-456-7890."
}

# Initialize NLP tools
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))

# Preprocess text
def preprocess_text(text):
    text = text.lower()  # Lowercase the text
    tokens = word_tokenize(text)  # Tokenize the text
    tokens = [word for word in tokens if word not in stop_words and word not in string.punctuation]
    tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in tokens]
    return tokens

# Define a function to find the intent
def find_intent(user_input):
    tokens = preprocess_text(user_input)
    for token in tokens:
        if token in faq_data:
            return token
    return None

# Chatbot interaction
def chatbot_response(user_input):
    intent = find_intent(user_input)
    if intent:
        return faq_data[intent]
    else:
        return "Sorry, I didn't understand your question. Can you please rephrase?"

# Example usage
user_inputs = [
    "What are your opening hours?",
    "Where is your location?",
    "Tell me about your services.",
    "How can I contact you?",
    "What is the meaning of life?"
]

for user_input in user_inputs:
    response = chatbot_response(user_input)
    print(f"User: {user_input}")
    print(f"Bot: {response}\n")
